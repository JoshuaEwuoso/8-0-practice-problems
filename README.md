## Categories of practice problems:

**01**- Given an **array** of objects, push one particular key (i.e. "name") of all the objects into an empty array, then return that array.

**02**- Given an **array** of objects, find the element that is the MOST _something_ (highest, oldest, youngest, shortest), then return that object.

**03**- Given an **array** of objects and a **target**, find the element that matches the target. If the target cannot be found, return either null, false, or an error message, depending on what the problem requires.
