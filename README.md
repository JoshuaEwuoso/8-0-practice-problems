# Supplementary Practice Problems

## Categories of practice problems:

1) Given an array of objects, push one particular key (i.e. "name") of all the objects into an empty array, then return that array.

2) Given an array of elements, find the element that is the MOST *something* (highest, oldest, youngest, shortest).

3) Given an array of elements and a target, find the element that matches the target. If the target cannot be found, return either null, false, or an error message, depending on what the problem requires.

4) Given an array of elements, set a condition and filter out elements that do not meet that condition. Return the filtered array.

5) Given an array of elements, categorize the elements and count how many elements there are of each type, then return an object containing that count.
