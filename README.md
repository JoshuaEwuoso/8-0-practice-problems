# Practice for Common Problem Patterns

As you've probably noticed, there are many common patterns that tend to pop up when it comes to problem solving. This will be true in real world practice too. Learning to solve each of these problem types is its own skill. The more adept you become at recognizing and solving each of these common types of problems, the better you'll get at solving more complex problems, which often include several of these problem types layered together.

## Categories of practice problems:

**01**- Given an **array** of objects, accumulate one particular key (i.e. "name") of all the objects, then return that accumulation. (getting totals and averages falls under this category too)

**02**- Given an **array** of objects, find the element that is the MOST _something_ (highest, oldest, youngest, shortest).

**03**- Given an **array** of objects and a **target**, find the element that matches the target. If the target cannot be found, return either null, false, or an error message, depending on what the problem requires.

**04**- Given an **array** of objects, set a condition and filter out elements that do not meet that condition. Return the filtered array.

**05**- Given an **array** of objects, categorize the elements and count how many elements there are of each type, then return the result.
